title: Online Store Manager
---

For our second project, we were tasked with creating an Online Store Manager (“OSM”) that can be used to create and manage online stores.

The purpose of this exploration was to explore Object Oriented Programming in Python and the associated class functionality. Currently, the functionality is very limited and can be considered a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) at this point that I expect to iterate on and update as I continue on my Pythonic journey.

For this project, I created two classes: an OSM class and an OnlineStore class.

The purpose of the OSM object is to store a list of all the stores it created. It also serves as a template for the products a store can sell and other basic functionality of the store. Further, each of the stores created using the OSM template has a Name, an Inventory, and a list of Customers.

Each OnlineStore object created by the OSM can sell items specified by the template. It also allows the store the functionality to add customers and stores a history of items purchased by those customers.
